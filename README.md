# 📰 Fake News Detection App

A machine learning project that detects fake news using NLP and Logistic Regression.  
Built as a portfolio project using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit — complete with a clean, shareable web app.


## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Built and trained a fake news classifier using real-world political news articles
- 🧠 Explored how well the model performs using:
  - Full article text
  - Headlines only
  - Noisy, typo-filled social-media-style headlines
- 💬 Tested custom headlines live
- 🌐 Created an interactive **Streamlit web app** where users can paste headlines and get real-time predictions with confidence scores
